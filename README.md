# StockTrader
A native iOS application written with SwiftUI 2 that allows users to search for
different stock symbols/tickers and view their detailed information (extracted through a Node.js backend from the Tiingo API, News API, and Highcharts). Additionally, users can trade with virtual money, create a portfolio, favorite stock symbols to track their stock prices, and view news articles and share them to Twitter. 

The app contains 2 screens: the Home screen and the Detailed Stock Information
screen. Each of these screens have multiple features to allow users to easily perform the functions listed above.
