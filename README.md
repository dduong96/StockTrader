# StockTrader
A native iOS application written with SwiftUI 2 that follows the MVVM design pattern and uses the Combine framework to allow users to search for
different stock symbols/tickers and view their detailed information. Data is fetched through a Node.js backend from the Tiingo API and News API and displayed with Highcharts. Additionally, users can trade with virtual money, create a portfolio, favorite stock symbols to track their stock prices, and view news articles and share them to Twitter. 

The app contains 2 screens: the Home screen and the Detailed Stock Information
screen. Each of these screens have multiple features to allow users to easily perform the functions listed above.
